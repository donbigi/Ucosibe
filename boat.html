          <strong>Background Info</strong>
        </h5>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          I assumed I work as a data analyst for a yacht and boat sales website.
          The marketing team is preparing a weekly newsletter for boat owners.
          The newsletter is designed to help sellers to get more views of their
          boat, as well as stay on top of market trends.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          They want me to look at the recent data and help them learn more about
          the characteristics of the most viewed boat listings in the last 7
          days - is it the most expensive boats that get the most views? Are
          there common features among the most viewed boats?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Data used for the project was provided by Datacamp
          <a
            href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/talent-assets.datacamp.com/boat_data.csv"
            target="_blank"
          >
            download here
          </a>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
          <strong>The dataset columns details</strong>
        </p>

        <div class="data-set-1-img-container">
          <img src="BoatSales/Table.jpg" class="boat-data-set" />
        </div>

        <h5><strong>Data Validation</strong></h5>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Python programming language was used  to clean and manipulate the dataset
          <a
            href="https://github.com/donbigi/Case-Study-Project---Boat-Sales/blob/main/data_validation.ipynb"
            target="_blank"
          >
            Click here
          </a>
          to view the complete cleaning and manipulation process
        </p>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          The ‘Price’ column contains both the currency and the numeric price. I
          split the column into two for easy calculations, separating the
          currency and price.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Splitting the price column enabled me to find all distinct currency.
        </p>
          There are four distinct currencies namely Swiss Franc
          (CHF), Euro (EUR), Danish Krone (DKK) and British Pound (Â£).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Since there is more than one currency, I converted the currencies to
          USD to have uniform value for the boat price.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          The date of purchase was not listed, so exchange rate used for the
          conversion was gotten from google currency converter and is valid for
          January 5, 2022. CHF rate = 1.09, EUR rate = 1.13, DKK rate = 0.15,
          Pound rate = 1.36.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          The size of the boats was not provided,the “length” and “width”
          columns were used find the size of the boats (Area = length x width).
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <strong>The Objective</strong>
          <br />
        </p>
        <ul class="after-boat-list">
          <li>What are the most viewed boats?</li>
          <li>is it the most expensive boats that get the most views?</li>
          <li>What are the common features among the most viewed boats?</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>Summary</strong> <br>
          Motor Yachht had the most views
          <ul class="after-boat-list">
            <li>Motor Yacht had 28.5% more views than the close second.`</li>
            <li>87% of the views were from the used market.</li>
          </ul>
          The price of a boat is not a factor for higher views <br>
          Used boats 
            gets more views than the new counterpart,modern boats (post 2000s) are viewed more.
          <p> <br>
            <strong> In-depth Analysis </strong>
          </p>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <strong>Note:</strong>
          the cost of the boats was converted to USD in order to have uniform
          price for all the boat listing.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Checking the top 20 boats by views, motor yacht tops the list as the
          most viewed boat.
        </p>

        <div class="data-set-1-img-container">
          <img src="BoatSales/slide_1.jpg" class="boat-data-set" />
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Looking specifically into the views count of the Motor Yachht showed 
          people are more interested in the used boat market.
        </p>

        <div class="data-set-1-img-container">
          <img src="BoatSales/slide2.jpg" class="boat-data-set" />
        </div>

        <p> People are more interested in the used boat market because it is
          relatively cheaper than the new counterpart.
        </p>

        <div class="data-set-1-img-container">
          <img src="BoatSales/slide3.jpg" class="boat-data-set" />
        </div>

        <p> Insight from the data shows that a higher price does not guarantee
          more views.</p>

        <div class="data-set-1-img-container">
          <img src="BoatSales/slide4.jpg" class="boat-data-set" />
        </div>

        <p> Customers visiting the site are more interested in modern boats
          (boats produced post-2000s).
        </p>

        <div class="data-set-1-img-container">
          <img src="BoatSales/slide5.jpg" class="boat-data-set" />
        </div>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h5><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          The most viewed boat is the “Motor Yacht.” It had significantly more 
          views than the second (about 100,000 more views). Looking deeper into 
          the “Motor Yacht” boat, most of its views come from the used boat market 
          because on average used boats are significantly cheaper than the new 
          counterpart (about 45% less on average).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          There is no positive correlation between the cost of the boat and views 
          count. Meaning that a boat being expensive is no guarantee customers will 
          view it.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Some of the features noticeable in the popular boats includes
          <ul class="after-boat-list">
            <li>Listing used boats. Customers are more likely to view the used boat
              section than the new because of the relatively affordable price. </li>
            <li>Boats built in the 2000s (modern boats) are more likely to be viewed 
              since they are newer (even if they are a used model).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <strong>Recommendations</strong> 
          <ul class="after-boat-list">
            <li>The used market is flourishing, capitalize on it to push more sales </li>
            <li>Encourage listing of modern boats, they are more likely to be viewed</li>
          </ul>
